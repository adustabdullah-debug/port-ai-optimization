# AI Framework for Port Optimization

This repository contains the implementation of an artificial intelligence framework for enhancing port resilience and intermodal supply chain efficiency, as described in the paper "An Artificial Intelligence Framework for Enhancing U.S. Port Resilience and Intermodal Supply Chain Efficiency."

## Overview

This project demonstrates:
- XGBoost regression for predicting vessel wait times and truck turn times
- Digital twin simulation of port operations using discrete-event modeling
- Integration of machine learning with operational optimization

## Dataset

Due to data use agreements, the original proprietary data from the Port of Los Angeles cannot be shared. However, this repository includes:
- `synthetic_port_data.csv`: Generated dataset mimicking real port operations
- `data_generator.py`: Script to regenerate synthetic data with similar statistical properties

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/port-ai-optimization.git
cd port-ai-optimization
pip install -r requirements.txt
